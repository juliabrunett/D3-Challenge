# D3-Challenge
**D3 Homework**: This project focused on using D3.js to generate a dynamic and interactive scatter plot from a provided csv file. The dataset in the csv file is collected from the U.S. Census Bureau's (2014 American Community Survey 1-year estimate)[https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=2014%20ACS%201-year%20estimate&tid=ACSDT1Y2014.B24020] & CDC's (2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey)[https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2014.html]. The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between health risk factors and demographic factors, to look at the correlation that may be present.
